# Salad Bowl Phone Gap App

## What's the Point?
We wanted to be able to play salad bowl, but using our phones. We were young and stupid and doing a 2-person 72-hour hackathon sprint, and thought that using PhoneGap to build the app using a webview for cross compatibility was a *good idea*. I've since learned the error of our ways.
